“Interactive Musical Instruments opens a gateway to creativity, where the expressive potential of music is unlocked with a touch. Guided by the vision that electronic musical instruments can have expressive capabilities comparable to acoustic instruments, I invented the Force Sensing Resistor (FSR).
These sensors form the backbone of the Interactive Musical Instrument (IMI) line, unleashing the potential of music-making for everyone. IMI instruments are effortless to play yet offer a lifetime of mastery.
The IMI system focuses on intention and feeling rather than traditional music theory. This resonates with those who may feel intimidated by the complexities of theory and removes the fear of hitting ‘wrong’ notes. The IMI system is to music what a calculator is to math — it redefines music-making and empowers pure emotion to flow through sound.”
