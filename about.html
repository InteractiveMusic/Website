    <h1>About the Founder</h1>

    <p>
      With funds earned from licensing the <em>Magical Musical Thing</em> to Mattel Toys, I patented the Force Sensing Resistor (FSR) in the 1980s. I then developed the Electronic Orchestra for Hasbro Toys and founded Interlink Electronics (NASDAQ: LINK) in 1985. After establishing Interlink as the first FSR company, I left in 1989 to pursue new innovations.

      In 1992, I licensed <em>The KEY</em> — a forerunner of the IMI line — to Lonestar Technologies, then the leading karaoke equipment manufacturer in the U.S. In 2001, I founded Sensitronics to sell FSRs to leading musical instrument companies. Today, Sensitronics continues to advance FSR technology, supplying a wide range of industries — from consumer products to medical and aerospace applications.
