  <h1>NoteAssist</h1>

  <p>NoteAssist allows new players to immerse themselves in a musical flow state — engaged and focused on the feeling, so it’s less about playing every note perfectly and more about expressing true intention.</p>

  <p>Favorite songs are downloaded as MIDI files — the standard Musical Instrument Digital Interface format — and with the help of AI, NoteAssist delivers the correct chords, lead, and bass notes to enrich a beginner’s musical experience. Players can mute any of the chord, lead, or bass tracks to create and play their own version.</p>

  <p><strong>SyncUp</strong> assigns one controller as the Conductor and the others as Players, creating a dynamic, collaborative ensemble. The Conductor’s controller transmits essential data packets to keep the Players in sync with the correct key, chord changes, melodies, and bass lines. The drum track provides a metronomic count-off for the starting tempo, ensuring everyone begins together and stays together.</p>

  <p>With today’s advanced mobile technology, computer-level smartphones provide excellent sound quality and textures, delivered wirelessly for recording and playback. This modern support system removes the need for an internal synthesizer and significantly lowers the cost of the controllers.</p>
