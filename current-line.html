  <h1>Current Instrument Line</h1>

  <p class="intro">I have developed five musical controllers following traditional forms. They are the WindBoard, MelodiKeyZ, DrumKit, Shaker, and the Syntar.</p>

  <div class="instrument">
  <h2>WindBoard</h2>
  <img src="images/Wind.jpg" alt="WindBoard">
  <p>The WindBoard is a digital woodwind controller with a recorder-like fingering system. Our patented FSR BreathSensor interprets the playerâ€™s intention and feeling, while lip rest sensors on the mouthpiece integrate pitch bend. For singalong, the WindBoard can be played without the BreathSensor, transferring expression to the touch-responsive keypads.</p>
</div>

<div class="instrument">
  <h2>MelodiKeyZ</h2>
  <img src="images/MelodiKeyZ.png" alt="MelodiKeyZ">
  <p>The MelodiKeyZ is a two-octave touch-responsive piano keyboard that can be handheld, played on a tabletop, or worn. It shares the same BreathSensor as the WindBoard, allowing notes to be powered by breath for harmonica or horn-like expression, or played like a typical keyboard using its touch-sensitive keypads.</p>
</div>

<div class="instrument">
  <h2>DrumKit</h2>
  <img src="images/DrumKit.png" alt="DrumKit">
  <p>The DrumKit features FSR drumming surfaces laid out like a standard drum set with five drums and five cymbals. Two tom-toms include note-bending like a talking drum, and the Auto-Roll is a pressure-controlled drum roll.</p>
</div>

<div class="instrument">
  <h2>Shaker</h2>
  <img src="images/ShakerFull.jpg" alt="Shaker">
  <p>The Shaker is a digital rhythm controller capable of a wide range of patterns and playing techniques. Its BendUp and BendDown controls allow drum voices to be melodically tuned in real time. The Shaker also demonstrates the NoteAssist application available to the other controllers.</p>
</div>

<div class="instrument">
  <h2>Syntar</h2>
  <img src="images/Syntar_Still.jpg" alt="Syntar">
  <p>The Syntar is a digital guitar controller with interchangeable body styles. It combines familiar guitar elements with synthesizer capabilities, including a variety of preset tunings. Note bending is achieved by pulling across the digital string simulators. Hammer-ons add speed and expression, while harmonic notes add texture. The StrummerVanes feature End-to-End capability for a seamless blend of synthesizer voices. The strum up/strum down distinction is programmable, and it also includes a selectable mute/whammy sensor.</p>
